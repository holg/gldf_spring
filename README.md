[![Java CI with Maven on macOS](https://github.com/holg/gldf_spring/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/holg/gldf_spring/actions/workflows/maven.yml)



Some sample demo Java Spring App to load the native gldf library (.so/.dll/.dylib) and use it inside Java Spring
There is some test.gldf and some test.json (which is the control output)
mvn test passes and verifies, that the gldf is loaded correctly
